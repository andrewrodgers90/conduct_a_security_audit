<h4>Recommendations:</h4>
As a result of this security audit, we can see that Botium Toys’ needs to implement multiple controls to improve its security posture, and better protect customer PII/SPII. <br> <br>
The suggested controls include; separation of duties, least privilege, more stringent password policies, password management system, disaster recovery plans, legacy system management, IDS (intrusion detection system), and encryption. <br> <br>
To remedy the numerous gaps in compliance, Botium Toys must implement controls such as; least privilege, separation of duties, and encryption. This is in addition to the proper classification of assets so that it may appropriately identify necessary controls, better protect customer PII/SPII, and further improve its security posture in the future.
